Code for Freund et al. "Muller’s ratchet and gene duplication" (2024+) - preprint on biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.27.630357. 

This repository contains 

 * **asympfreqs_recfun.R**: The exact, but non-explicit, recursive description of the equilibria for CCM and STM
 * **ml_approx_infer_zebraf_human.R**: The ML grid inference method for parameter estimation and model selection for zebrafish and human gene families
 * The copy counts from zebrafish (within **ml_approx_infer_zebraf_human.R**) and the copy counts from three human populations (the .csv files). This data is publicly available and originates from Schäfer et al. (2024,https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98058: zebrafish) and Brahmachary et al. (2014,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004418: human).
