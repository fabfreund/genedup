Code for gene duplication vs selection model paper - preprint soon on biorxiv!

This repository contains 

 * **asympfreqs_recfun.R**: The exact, but non-explicit, recursive description of the equilibria for CCM and STM
 * **ml_approx_infer_zebraf_human.R**: The ML grid inference method for parameter estimation and model selection for zebrafish and human gene families
 * The copy counts from zebrafish (within **ml_approx_infer_zebraf_human.R**) and the copy counts from three human populations (the .csv files)  

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
